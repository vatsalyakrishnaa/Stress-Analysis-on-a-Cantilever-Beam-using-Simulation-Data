# Stress Analysis on a Cantilever Beam using Simulation Data (Stress-Analysis-on-a-Cantilever-Beam-using-Simulation-Data)

This mini project demonstrates how simulation-based data analytics can be used to understand the relationship between **load, distance, and resulting stress** on a cantilever beam.  
Using a simplified analytical model, this project simulates data, performs calculations in Python, and visualizes how stress behaves under different conditions.

## 🧩 Project Overview

1. Created simulated data for beam load and distance parameters.  
2. Calculated **bending moment (M = Load × Distance)**.  
3. Computed **stress** using a proportional constant to approximate material behavior.  
4. Visualized the relationship between load, distance, and stress using Python’s Matplotlib.  
5. Exported analyzed results to Excel for documentation.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib (for plotting)
- **Excel** (for initial data entry and result export)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Key Insights

- Stress increases proportionally with load under constant distance.  
- Stress varies along the beam length depending on the applied load location.  
- Data visualization helps interpret stress distribution trends effectively.
