# CAE Mini Project: Beam Stress Analysis
# Stress-Analysis-on-a-Cantilever-Beam-using-Simulation-Data

## Objective
This mini project demonstrates how simulation data can be used to analyze and visualize the relationship between load, distance, and resulting stress on a cantilever beam. The project applies basic engineering principles with Python-based data analysis to simulate, calculate, and interpret stress distribution trends.

## Dataset
- `beam_stress_data.xlsx`: Contains Load, Distance, Moment, Stress

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis
- Stress vs Load plot
- Stress vs Distance plot

## Insights
- Stress increases linearly with applied load.
- Stress variation along the beam helps understand mechanical behavior under load.

## Files Included
- beam_stress_data.xlsx — Initial simulation dataset
- beam_stress_analysis.ipynb — Python notebook for calculations & visualization
- README.md — Project documentation

  ## Future Improvements
  - Extend to 3D modeling using FEM tools
  - Add automated parameter variation
  - Integrate with simulation APIs like SimScale or FreeCAD
