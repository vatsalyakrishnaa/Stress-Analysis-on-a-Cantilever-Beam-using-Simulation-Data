# Stress-Analysis-on-a-Cantilever-Beam-using-Simulation-Data
This mini project demonstrates how simulation data can be used to analyze and visualize the relationship between load, distance, and resulting stress on a cantilever beam. The project applies basic engineering principles with Python-based data analysis to simulate, calculate, and interpret stress distribution trends.
